# Remove-Jamf

![CI](https://github.com/steinbrueckri/remove-jamf/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

Hello folks,
maybe someone of you also has problems with this "Jamf" thing. ;)
That's why I put this together, so you don't have to search for it again.

- convert mobile user account to a local user
  - see [mobiletolocal.pl](mobiletolocal.pl)
- disable Jamf agent
  - see [disable-jamf.md](disable-jamf.md)

Cheers Richard üçª
